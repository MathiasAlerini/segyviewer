# segyviewer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/equinor/segyviewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/equinor/segyviewer)


Segyviewer is a small LGPL licensed python library for easy viewing of
SEG-Y files. It uses the
**[segyio library](https://github.com/equinor/segyio)**
for reading files.

This project also provides the
[`segyviewlib`](https://pypi.org/project/segyviewlib/)
which is a collection of views that can be used in other Python
projects.

## Getting started

Segyviewer is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/segyviewer/)
through pip and installed with

```bash
pip install segyviewer
```

to open segyviewer with your chosen <file.segy>
```bash
segyviewer <file.segy>
```

### Configuring the view

You can select from a multitude of **colormaps** (see the
[documentation from Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html)
for an overview).  The default color is the industry standard
"`seismic`" color.

The optimal **layout** (the position of the tiles) of the
crossline/inline/depth windows depends on the SEG-Y file.  It is
therefore possible to configure the layout.

Finally, it is possible to configure various settings such as the
current cube, colormap interpolation, export, etc.

## Build Segyviewer

To build segyviewer you need:

 * [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7 or 3.x.
 * [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) version 1.10 or greater
 * [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) version 28 or greater
 * [setuptools-scm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools_scm)
 * [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
 * [segyio](https://github.com/equinor/segyio)
 * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

To build and install segyviewer, perform the following actions in your console:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/segyviewer
cd segyviewer
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

Please note that the required library PyQt5 is not listed in requirements.txt. QT not longer
supports PyQt5 and as such it is not possible to pip install PyQt5.
Setup.py, which uses pip, would fail if PyQt5 was listed in requirements.txt.
